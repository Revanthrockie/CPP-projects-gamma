# Cpp-projects-gamma

I'm creating a set of easy projects for CPP beginners (so it is called Gamma) who can go through these and ace your coding skills don't worry I know its tough to master coding skills but I'll help you get through it.

I am building this complete course for you to learn. At beginning it was difficult for me to even understand I wasted tons of time, 'NO' matter how many times u learn C++ from a website or a video its not much of use if u don't start doing projects.. Make sure u follow through the projects I've created below so u could understand and make complete use of it.

What all this repo contains..
1.Algorithms for you to solve various problems ( You can find this in Algorithm branch).
1.1 - learning algorithms help you understand how to tacle various problems
2.projects:
 a) Calculator
 b) Currency exchange
 c) Card-validator
