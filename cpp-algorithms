Algorithms for various problems...
I'll be writing this as I learn new things along my way.


1.Luhn Algorithms:
 { *used for validating credit card numbers
  For eg- 4093 0568 1173 9858
  we make two parts the even places and the odd places
  count the numbers from left to right starting from 0.

  A. Starting from odd(right to left):
  1. To get this number [n = number/100; n = n % 10].
  2. Iterate the step-1 through entire card numbers.
  3. Add all the numbers. [sum of all odd numbers = oddsum].

  B. Starting from even(right to left):
  1. to get these numbers [n = number/100]
